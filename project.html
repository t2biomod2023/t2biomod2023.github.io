                                The micro invader game is recreating "Space Invader" ,what is retro game, in a micro-sized form using bio-molecules.
                                "Space Invader" is a game where players shoot down enemies attacking from space using bullets. The micro invader game consists of three main components imitating those.

                                The first component is the enemy, which is made up of liposomes and nucleic acid chains. Enemies fluoresce in red.
                                The second component is the bullet, which is made of silica beads and nucleic acid chains.
                                The last component is the cannon, which is a mechanism whereby the bullet is fired by the player's manipulation. A strand displacement reaction of nucleic acids is used.

                                These parts are placed on a field designed using avidin-biotin protein and nucleic acid strands (call it Base strand )on a glass surface.
                                Base strands have complementary sequence to strands on the barrette surface and on the Enemy. This allows the barrettes and the enemy to stay on the field.
                                The bullets are placed at end of the field. And at the other end of it, the enemy is placed.
                                (The nucleotide sequence of the part where the Enemy is placed has a complementary sequence to the nucleotide sequence on the Enemy.)

                                The basic structure of the Enemy is a liposome.
                                The enemy's liposome has two types of DNA strands with cholesterol modifications in the center, penetrating the membrane.
                                The outer parts of the DNA strands in the Enemy liposome have a complementary sequence to the DNA strand on the surface of the bullet and hybridizes.
                                The inner ends of each DNA strand are modified with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively.
                                When the DNA strand on the bullet and the two DNA strands on the Enemy hybridize, the DNA strands on the Enemy come closer to each other.
                                This causes FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) between the fluorescent substances, changing the color of the enemy from red to green.
                                This color change represents the defeat of the enemy in the "Space Invader".

                                The bullets consist of DNA strands on the surface of a silica bead that are complementary to the strands on the field and on the Enemy.
                                The bullet is anchored to the field by hybridization with Base strands.
                                To run the bullet towards the enemy, RNase-H is used; RNase-H specifically hydrolyzes the RNA in the DNA/RNA double-stranded structure.
                                This enzyme hydrolyzes the base-strand (RNA) hybridizing with DNA on the Bullet surface.
                                Bullets that have lost their foothold can move on the field by rolling on the field and hybridize with new Base strands on the field.

                                The canon is composed of two types of RNA strands, called Stopper strand and Trigger strand.
                                Stopper strand is complementary to Base strand, and Trigger strand is complementary to Stopper strand.
                                When the stopper strands are placed in a part of the field, those form double-stranded RNA with Base strands.
                                RNase-H does not hydrolyze RNA/RNA double strands, preventing the bullet from advancing beyond that point.
                                The Trigger strand has a sequence that is completely complementary to the Stopper strand, so when the Trigger strand is added to the field
                                (,where Stopper/Base double strands exist), strand displacement reaction occurs and the Trigger and Stopper strands become a double strand.
                                In other words, this removes the Stopper strand from Base strand.
                                As a result, the Bullet is able to move toward the Enemy.
                                The player of the Micro Invader Game can then drop the Trigger strand onto the field to fire the bullets.
                                This action is called "Cannon" and represents the firing of bullets in "Space Invaders".
