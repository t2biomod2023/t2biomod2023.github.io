        <h2>Abstract </h2>
        <p>Our love of biology and games led us to note the similarities between the Invader Game and the immune system in terms of defeating foreign enemies. We therefore decided to create an immune-like molecular system at the microscale. We call it the "Micro invader game". The invader game is simplified into three components: bullets, a cannon and enemies. The bullets consist of DNA-modified microbeads that roll and move on a flat surface  with RNAs for a substrate. The cannon fires the bullets by removing the stopper DNA on the surface that restricts the movement of the bullets. The enemies are made of liposomes, which fluoresce and/or self-destruct when hit by the bullet. The design of the enemies mimics the basic mechanisms of living organisms that respond to external stimuli. We believe our system, especially the sense-response mechanism of the enemy's design,could lead to new insights in the development of artificial life and drug delivery systems.
